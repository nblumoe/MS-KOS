# Introduction

MS-KOS [em ˈes keɪ əʊz] are Micro Services in Chaos

This is an example implementation and playground for running Micro Services with
Docker, Consul, Registrator and Prometheus.

## Attention

At the moment this only works with Docker 1.6
Update for newer Docker versions soon. You would need to take care of the
network bridge, if you want to use Docker 1.7.
