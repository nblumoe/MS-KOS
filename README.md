# Introduction

MS-KOS [em ˈes keɪ əʊz] are Micro Services in Chaos

This is an example implementation and playground for running Micro Services with
Docker, Consul, Registrator and Prometheus.

## Attention

If you are using Docker 1.7+ you might need to disable or tweak your firewall to
make this work. Seems to be a bug in Docker:
https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14396

With Docker 1.6 I did not encounter that issue.
